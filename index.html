          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead">I'm David Patch, an interactive software developer from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
              I graduated summa cum laude from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in May of 2022, 
              and I will receive my bachelors and masters degrees in Game Design and Development once I complete my final co-op credit.
              Due to my interests in digital development and sound design, I also minored in Software Engineering and Music Technology.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Outside of classes, my interests include PC gaming and music. 
            I played in several music ensembles on campus while taking my classes, even holding the position of Conductor for the RIT Pep Band from Fall 2019 through Spring 2020.</p>
          <p class="lead">I had the pleasure of working full-time for Cigna from June through October in 2020. 
            While there, I learned and worked with Oracle APEX and PLSQL to provide internal services to the company.</p>
          <p class="lead">I am currently searching for a co-op or full-time position.</p>

          <h2><em>Through the Lens</em></h2>
          <a class="download" href="https://oneredshoe.itch.io/through-the-lens">GDD Masters Capstone Project</a>
          <p><em>Through the Lens</em> is a 3D narrative exploration game in which you play as a character traversing the abandoned apartment building in which their family lived 40 years prior. 
            Back then, a nuclear reactor meltdown had caused an evacuation, which had split up the character's family, uprooting them from the complex that multiple generations had lived within. 
            You, the character, find themselves here after you found an old shoebox of photos your grandfather had taken, but dormant family issues and drama rekindled. 
            You hope to understand the bigger picture more clearly. The apartment is dilapidated, and, as much as it could be in arid New Mexico, is beginning to be reclaimed by nature. 
            Not everything could be packed up and taken. 
            Stories are uncovered here.</p>
          <p>I was the lead sound designer for my team, Hungry Turtle Studios. I also worked on level design and game design, and I assisted with project architecture.</p>

                      <em>Wrath of the Bony Boys</em>, previously called <em>Grave Escape</em>, is a single-player, satire-horror game created over a five-week span. 
                      I worked with four other GDD students on this project - Simon Demirjian, Adam Hall, Drake Richards, and John Vance. 
                      This game has the player running around a foggy graveyard and forest to collect pumpkins, all while being chased by a troop of skeletons. 
                      These skeletons are floating, tumbling, and ragdolling toward the player, and every so often they jump into the air. 
                      I did the sound design for the game, the skeletons' obstacle avoidance, and part of the menu system.

                        This game was made over the course of a semester in a research studio course focused on experimental gameplay. 
                        <em>Two Gnomes in a Trenchcoat</em> is a two-player cooperative audio-only game, meaning it has no visuals to speak of (hence the blank screenshot). 
                        The players take on the roles of two members of a tabletop RPG game group with an under-prepared and overly-spiteful game master (GM). 
                        The player characters are playing as two half-deaf gnomes in a trenchcoat. 
                        As such, the player on the left  is given one side of a set of headphones, and the player on the right is given the other. 
                        The players hear independent audio. Both channels of audio are required to pass the quick-time events that make up the game, so communication is necessary.
                        Myself and Alex Herman are the sole developers of this project. 
                        I developed the main game loop and structure of the event system. 
                        I also designed levels three and four (a horseback chase and a bard-off) of the four-level game.

                        This replica of the classic 80s game <em>Asteroids</em> was created in Unity 2D using C# scripts. 
                        I was the sole developer for this project. 
                        Just like the original game, this replica utilizes vector-based movement and forces to move objects around the screen. 
                        The goal is to destroy all of the asteroids on the screen by shooting them with the ship's laser. 
                        I themed the project around Star Fox, and as such, all of the sound clips in the game were taken from Fox McCloud's character in 
                        <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, and the ship itself is modeled after Fox's arwing ship from his main series.

                    Hectic Hockey is a two-player air hockey game where an additional puck spawns for each goal scored. 
                    This academic project was done using C++ in OpenGL. 
                    I handled collision resolution between pucks and goals, as well as most of the UI elements. 
                    Each object in the scene has a bounding sphere or box that can be visually toggled on or off. 
                    Our group used a grid for spatial partitioning, and I added a way to turn it on and off to showcase its effectiveness at keeping the frame rate up. 
                    Unfortunately, the frame rate only started tanking when several hundred pucks were on screen at once, so I also made the 'P' key add one-hundred pucks to the scene per press in order to get to that point.

                  The DSA Maze game was a partner project in C++ done with Adam Hall for our Data Structures and Algorithms course. 
                  The goal was to create a DLL that implements A* pathfinding that works with other applications. 
                  The application we used to run the DLL had two teams' pathfinding algorithms race against each other. 
                  Ours was around the middle of the pack for our class. I made several unit tests for the project. 
                  I also created the graph data structure that utilized a priority queue (created by Adam) to organize all of the nodes of a maze and did the pathfinding using A*. 
                  Even though this project had heavy use of pointers, we still managed to avoid memory leaks. 
                  It should be noted that Adam and I worked cooperatively on nearly every aspect of this project over the months we worked on it, so we each had a hand in every part of it.

                <p><em>Chronoshift</em> is a tabletop role-playing game about collaborative storytelling in a world of industry, magic, and time loops.</p>
                  <p><em>
                  The land of Hearth is in danger.
                  Chronoshifts, once a rare phenomenon, have begun to spread at the behest of the mysterious Otherlings. 
                  Within the Chronoshifts, events repeat over and over again without end. 
                  Those caught inside are forced to re-enact their actions every loop without realizing they've done it all before.
                  You are different. 
                  Time is on your side when you enter the Chronoshift, because your memories remain between every loop. 
                  Learn from each loop and harness the sands of time to bend Chronoshifts to your advantage. 
                  You may be the last hope this world has left.
